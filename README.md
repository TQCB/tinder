# Tinder Speed Dating Analysis - Decrypting People's Behaviour

This project explores the factors that influence attraction and people's
behaviour in the world of dating. We also take a look more specifically at
differences between people's perception compared to reality.

## Goal:
Identify characteristics that lead to a higher chance of a second date.

## Methods:

Descriptive statistics: Summarizing key data points.
Data visualizations: Creating insightful charts and graphs.
Analysis of participant ratings on qualities like attractiveness, intelligence, and shared interests.
Deliverables:

## Jupyter notebook containing:
Descriptive statistics of the dataset.
Visualizations exploring factors influencing second date selections.
Interpretations of the findings to understand user preferences.
Project Benefits:

## This analysis can inform Tinder on how to:

- Improve user profiles to emphasize important qualities.
- Refine matching algorithms to prioritize compatible users based on data-driven insights.

## Key Findings:

- **Confidence is King (and Queen):** Participants expressing confidence and interest are more likely to land matches and second dates. Put yourself out there!
- **Openness Wins:** Prioritizing race in a partner shows a negative correlation with second dates. Explore your options!
- **Be Honest with Yourself (But Maybe Not About Looks):** Participants understand their own strengths, but overvalue attractiveness and underestimate ambition. Focus on what truly matters.
- **We Misjudge Our Appeal:** We tend to overestimate how attractive we find "traditional" traits like looks and shared interests, while underestimating sincerity and ambition. Look beyond the surface!
- **Attraction is Contagious (But Ambition is Not):** Matching with someone seen as attractive can boost your perceived appeal, while matching with someone lacking ambition can have the opposite effect. Find someone who inspires you!
- **Self-Perception Can Be Warped:** The most misinterpreted attribute is attractiveness, likely influenced by self-esteem and social factors. Be objective!
- **Misperception Snowballs:** Misjudging one trait often leads to misjudging others. Take a step back and re-evaluate!
- **Confidence Boosts Self-Awareness (Maybe):** A slight trend suggests those with strong interests are more confident in self-perception. Pursue your passions!
- **Dating is Complex:** While self-assessment plays a role, strong correlations elude us, highlighting the multifaceted nature of human attraction. Stay curious and open-minded!
